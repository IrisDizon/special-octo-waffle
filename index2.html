                    <h2>The Marshall Mathers LP (2000)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Upon its release in May 2000, Eminem's third album was surrounded in controversy. Recorded with Dr Dre in just two months, The Marshall Mathers LP saw more introspective lyricism and often veers into the more disturbing hardcore hip-hop and horrorcore area. It drew criticism for its violent, homophobic and misogynistic lyrics but praise for its emotional depth was louder.

                        <p>
                            The fact that this collection of hits from Eminem's career between 1999 - 2005 still regularly appears in the Official Charts is proof alone of his impact on music.
                            In fact, the retrospective hasn't left the Top 40 all year, pushing its combined sales to 2.1 million to date.

                                Eminem's fourth album fully established his global superstar status, topping the charts in 19 countries, including the Official UK Albums Chart.

                                <p>
                                    Eminem's fifth album is one of his most divisive records yet. Released after five years of non-stop album releases and touring, many critics felt he was suffering from burnout on Encore, lacking the innovation of his previous albums. Others view it as Eminem's transitional record from comedy rapper to serious commentator. Featuring chart-topping singles Just Lose It and Like Toy Soldiers, Encore has shifted 1.3 million in the UK, 1.2 of which are physical CD sales.

                                    <p>
                                        Eminem's major label debut was a slow burner in the UK and Eminem's only UK release not to reach Number 1, peaking at 10 over a year after its initial release. Regardless, its impact on US rap can't be denied. Produced by his idol Dr Dre, Eminem brought a unique and often controversial lyrical style that led many to label it one of the great debuts in hip-hop. It's combined sales are 1.1 million.

                                            Originally planned to be Relapse 2 and released in the same year as its predecessor, the album's title was changed after Eminem felt the music has progressed beyond its original concept.

                                            <p>
                                                Arriving after a four-year hiatus after suffering from writer's block and being treated for addiction to prescription sleeping pills, critics were divided at the time when it came to Eminem's lyrics and performance on Relapse. Highlights include the 50 Cent assisted Crack A Bottle, and the surprisingly touching (and slightly screwed up) Beautiful. The sales are still impressive, however: 591,000 across all formats.
